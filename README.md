# RWA Project
Rich Web Applications Project using node.js and TypeScript

# Abstract
The purpose of this assignment was to develop skills and the knowledge on how to create a professional and engaging web application that will enhance the user experience when using the app. Some of the technologies  used to achieve this goal were HTML, CSS and TypeScript. For this assignment,is to create a food app that provides details about the type of restaurants that people can dine in throughout Ireland, also it had to include certain details of each restaurant like the title of the restaurant, address, picture of restaurant, opening hours, cuisines and facilities.

# Features
*	A visually appealing home page.
*	A selector for the counties.
*	A list of all restaurants within a selected county.
*	Details of each restaurant.
*	The option to submit a review.

# How it works
Website includes a bootstrap navigation bar template which learned from following a tutorial on tutorialspoint. To link each page of the web application used the angular component RouterLink.
This component allowed to traverse this web application with ease. For each county page,it run the summary-service which has the details needed for each restaurant. This allowed to continuously update the website and add a new restaurant very easily without making any CSS changes to the we application.
